# Magic The Gathering Scripts

A hodge podge repository for Magic The Gathering Scripts, for wizards and wizarding folks alike (but **not** druids).

## mtgenerator

The `mtgenerator/gen_suggestion.py` script when run directly generators deck theme suggestions.

Additionally `mtgenerator.py` proivides code for a discord bot, which allows one to use the `gen_suggestionf.py` as a command in a discord server (not hosted as a standalone bot at this point).
